# Factory Design Pattern

The goal of the Factory Pattern is to help write code that separates creation from use. In other words, you should create your objects in a different place than where you use them.

## Advantages

The Factory Pattern helps us maintain the Single Responsibility principle of the SOLID framework as our classes and objects will handle only a single specifically defined task.

## Disadvantages

The addition of extra classes will inevitably lead to code that is more verbose and less readable.
